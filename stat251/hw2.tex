\subsection*{3.32}
a. $\Pt{family has 1 child $|$ chosen child is eldest} = \frac{\Pt{chosen child is eldest $|$ family has 1 child}\Pt{family has 1 child}}{\Pt{chosen child is eldest}}$. The probability that the chosen child is eldest is $\sum_1^4 p_i/i=0.41\bar{6}$, where we add up the probabilities of a family having $i$ children ($p_i$) times the probability that the eldest is chosen out of $i$ ($1/i$). Probability that a family has 1 child is $p_1=0.1$, and the eldest child is certainly selected, so the overall probability is $0.24$. If we do this with the youngest child, the probability remains the same, since no probability here actually depends on the ordering of the ages of the children.

b. $\Pt{family has 4 children $|$ chosen child is eldest} = \frac{\Pt{chosen child is eldest $|$ family has 4 children}\Pt{family has 4 children}}{\Pt{chosen child is eldest}}$. The first probability in the numerator is $0.25$, $p_4=0.3$, so the overall probability is $0.18$. The answer remains the same again if we use the youngest child instead.
\subsection*{3.56}
We want to find $\Pt{$n$th coupon is a new coupon $|$ $n$th coupon is of type $i$}$ summed over $i$. This is equivalent to \\
$\Pt{$n$th coupon is of type $i$ $|$ no coupons before $n$ were of type $i$}$. Since the probability of receiving a coupon is independent of previously received coupons, this is just the product of the two probabilities, or $p_i(1-p_i)^{n-1}$. Sum this over $i$ to get the answer.
\subsection*{3.58}
a. We have $P(H)=\Pt{second flip is H}\Pt{first flip is T}=p(1-p)$ and $P(T)=\Pt{second flip is T}\Pt{first flip is H}=(1-p)p=P(H)$.

b. In this case, if the first flip is a T, we are guaranteed to end with an H since we take the flip that breaks the streak and H is the only thing that could break the streak. Similarly, if the first flip is a H, we are guaranteed to end with a T. Thus, if the coin is unfair to begin with, this will result in an equally unfair scheme.
\subsection*{3.64}
Option (a) gives the correct answer with probability $p$. In option (b), the probability of them giving the correct answer is $\Pt{they agree on the common answer}+\Pt{they disagree and the coin flip is in favor of the correct answer}$. The first probability is $p^2$, and the second probability is $2p(1-p)\cdot1/2=p(1-p)=p-p^2$, so the sum is still $p$. Thus, the strategies are equally good.
\subsection*{3.76}
The probability that event $E$ occurs before $F$ is equal to the sum over all natural numbers $n$ of $\Pt{Event $E$ occurs on the $n$th iteration $|$ neither event $E$ nor event $F$ occur before event $n$}$. Since iterations of experiments are independent, this reduces to a product. The first term is $P(E)$, and the second term is $(1-(P(E)+P(F)))^{n-1}$, since $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive. Thus, summing from $1$ to $\infty$ gives $\frac{P(E)}{P(E)+P(F)}$.
\subsection*{3.90}
Consider the complement of this, or when one of outcomes 1 or 2 fail to occur. Denote the former by $E$ and the latter by $F$. Then, we are looking for $P(E\cup F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E\cap F)$. We have $P(E)=(p_0+p_2)^n$ (all outcomes are either 0 or 2), $P(F)=(p_0+p_1)^n$ (all outcomes are either 0 or 1), and $P(E\cap F)=p_0^n$ (all outcomes must be 0 for both 1 and 2 to fail to occur). Thus, the probability is $(p_0+p_1)^n+(p_0+p_2)^n-p_0^n$.

\subsection*{3.5}
a. True. We have $P(F|E)=\frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)}\leq\frac{P(E)P(F)}{P(E)}=P(F)$. If we assume positive information, then $P(F|E)=\frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)}\geq\frac{P(E)P(F)}{P(E)}=P(F)$

b. False. Suppose $F=G$ and $F$ is disjoint from $E$. Then $P(E|F)=P(G|E)=0$, both less than or equal to $P(E)$ and $P(G)$, resp., but $P(G|F)=1\geq P(G)$.

c. False. Suppose we are choosing random integers uniformly distributed from $0$ to $10$. Let $G$ be the event of a number in $[0,7]$. $F$ be the event of a number in $[5,10]$, and $E=F\cap G$. Then $P(E|F)<1/2$ and $P(E|G)<1/2$, but $P(E|FG)=1$. 

If we use positive information in (b), it's still false: consider the random number thing again, let $F=[0,5]$, $E=[2,7]$, $G=[4,9]$. We have $P(E|F)=3/5>P(F)$ and $P(G|E)=3/5>P(G)$, but $P(G|F)=1/5<P(G)$.

If we use positive information in (c), it's still false: let $F=[0,4]$, $G=[4,8]$, and $E=\{0,8\}$. Then $P(E|F)=P(E|G)=1/4>P(E)=1/5$, but $E$ and $FG$ have empty intersection.
